Algorithmic research revolves around multimodal interaction and modeling, with internship tasks involving LLM and image generation. Currently seeking positions related to multimodal algorithms and AIGC.

I will obtain master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China, supervised by Associate Professor Yu Jun, with corporate mentors Peng Chang, the head of the multimodal group at the Silicon Valley Research Institute of Ping An Technology in the United States, and Iek-Heng Chu. I graduated from Guangzhou University with a bachelor's degree, supervised by Professor Jin Li, the executive dean of the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, and Associate Professor Xianmin Wang. Currently, I have contributed to the publication of more than 10 articles. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MmZ_y1QAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

During my undergraduate years, I frequently participated in algorithm competitions and wrote [blogs](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43999137?type=blog). I was a member of the Atmosphere team and served as a member of the Alibaba Security Student Expert Group. I was ranked in the [Top 10 of the Alibaba Security Challenger Program](https://s.alibaba.com/challenge?spm=a2c22.12281976.0.0.46db2a69WaN1Te).

My research interests include:
- Multimodal interaction and modeling (CV/NLP)
- AIGC
- Fine-grained image recognition
- Robust machine learning

My business directions include:
- Large language models
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data mining
- Style transfer (AE, GAN, Diffusion)
- Object detection
